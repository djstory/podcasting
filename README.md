## Getting to Know GarageBand



### Start Your Project

- Open GarageBand and start a new project
  - Don't select "Voice," select empty project and check detail tab
- Setup GB for podcasting (rather than recording music)
  - Turn off metronome and counter, set to time (minutes and seconds)
  - Turn off master effects
  - Save your project
- Note the explore tool



###Setup Your Tracks

- Create a new track, then duplicate for a total of 5 tracks, then label them
- Import music
- Record intro and outro
  - Find a good level and distance—make sure you're not distorting
- Import main podcast audio



### Edit

- Remove unwanted portions of a tracks
- Move track regions to where you want them—go for a stairstep down formation
- AFTER everything is in place, create the fade-in and fade-out for music tracks
- Checkout the master track—it is applying compression and setting your overall volume



### Save and Export

- Export as MP3



### If There's Time...

- If there's time...throw together your own jingle with GB loops
